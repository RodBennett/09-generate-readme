In this assignment, I generated a README markdown through the command line with Node.JS.  The npm package Inquirer was also used for question prompting in the command line.

After runninng <node index.js> in the command line, the program begins running a series of questions for the user to answer.

After all of the questions are answered, the data from the answers get transferred to a new README.md file complete with badge license, a title, and a Table of Contents with hyperlinks that navigate the user quickly to the section of the README they click on.

## Future Development

In its most basic sense, this was among the simplest assignments we've done so far in the class, but I feel there's much further to go in terms of refinement of README files.  For example, in the future I would like to experiment with more section breakers and headers, as well as weights and colors for fonts in README files.  I've seen some beautiful READMEs with company logos embedded into them, etc, and would like to improve my Markdown skills accordingly.
